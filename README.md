# Description

My app is a restaurant finder app that displays the search results of different restaurants in Chicago. I used the Zomato api to render the information such as the restaurants' name, address, type of cuisineaverage cost for two guests and a like to the menu. My app also rendered a photo of the restaurant or food served at the restaurant from the zomato api. I've worked in the restaurant industry for many years so this project was personal for me. I found the price point for two guests property really interesting as well. A good meal can get really expensive!

### User Stories
-As a user I want to find the hottest (new) restaurants in my city.
-As a user I'd like to find restaurants that are open during the pandemic and see which
restaurants have closed as well
### MVP Goals
I'll have a search form for the user to render results based on input. It will return data as well as imagery. 
### Stretch Goals
I would like to create a michelin starred component to my app as well that will allow users to see what restaurants return michelin starred results.
